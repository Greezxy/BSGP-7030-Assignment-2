# Assignment 3: Annotated Linear Regression and Git/GitHub Workflow

## Overview
This repository contains the completed work for Assignment 3, which involves performing linear regression in both Python and R, visualizing results with annotated plots, and practicing version control using Git and GitHub.

## Contents
- `linear_model_notebook_python.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with linear regression analysis, model interpretation, and annotated plot.
- `linear_model_notebook_r.ipynb`: R Jupyter Notebook with similar analysis and explanations.
- `linear_model_notebook_python.py`: Python script that outputs regression metrics and saves the annotated plot as `regression_plot_python.png`.
- `linear_model_notebook_r.r`: R script that performs the same tasks and saves the plot as `regression_plot_r.png`.
- `regression_plot_python.png`: Output plot from Python script.
- `regression_plot_r.png`: Output plot from R script.
- `regression_data.csv`: Dataset file.
- `README.md`: This file describes the repository structure and contents.

## GitHub Workflow
- Work completed on the `assignment3` branch and merged into `main`.
- Final submission tagged as `assignment3-final`.
